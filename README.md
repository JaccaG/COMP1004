# COMP1004 - SPA

For this project I decided to make a Personal Budget Tracker.
It is an application designed for users to manage their finances responsibly
and visualise their spending and income to see where they may be able to save money or cut costs. 

This application has lots of features. Those features include
the ability to add income and add expenses. The user is also able to view the dashboard
which contains their total amount, which is income minus expenses, there is also a visualisation
of their income and expenses in the form of doughnut charts where they can visualise what percentage of their inputs 
is taking up their income or expenditure. The user is also able to download and upload JSON files containing their
information. The file that is uploaded can be edited and redownloaded.

The vision for this project was to create an application that would make it nice and simple for
users to manage their finances and create an overview that simplifies their view of their monetary status.
This is because I believe now more than ever the chances of becoming financial insecure is at an all time high.
The UK is currently in a recession with inflation rampaging and wages are so stagnant they have been as high as 5% 
behind inflation leading to a massive rise in poverty and a cost-of-living crisis. So the need to be able to manage
your money to the best of your ability is crucial at this time. So my vision is to assist those who are some of the
most financially vulnerable in society.
